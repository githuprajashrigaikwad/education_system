    <p class="sectionSubTag"> The purpose of primitive education is thus to guide children to becoming good members of their tribe or band. 
        There is a marked emphasis upon training for citizenship, because primitive people are highly concerned with the growth of individuals as tribal members and the thorough comprehension of their way of life during passage from prepuberty to postpuberty.

    <p class="sectionSubTag">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. 
        Education has the popwer to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

        The Industrial Revolution was a period of major economic and social transformation; not surprisingly major changes in education occurred during that period as well.
